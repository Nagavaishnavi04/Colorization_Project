# Colorization_Project

# Task 1 - Visualizing the Colorization Process

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This task demonstrates the process of colorizing grayscale images using a CNN-based model. The key focus is to **visualize intermediate stages** of the colorization process to understand how the model progressively adds color.

# Task 2 - Colorization of Historical Photographs

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To colorize black-and-white historical images with an emphasis on **period-accurate color reproduction** (e.g., World War II, 1920s).

# Task 3 - Cross-Domain Image Colorization

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To implement an adaptable model capable of colorizing different domains:
- Sketch â†’ Art
- Infrared satellite â†’ RGB Image
- Grayscale Photo â†’ Colorized Output
