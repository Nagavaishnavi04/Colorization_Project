# Task 1 - Visualizing the Colorization Process

## 📌 Objective
Visualizing the Colorization Process. Description: Visualize the intermediate stages of your model's colorization process to better understand how the image transitions from grayscale to color. Guidelines: Use visual tools to demonstrate how colorization progresses across your model's layers or stages. GUI is not necessary.


## 🛠️ Files Included
- `Task1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for preprocessing, training, and visualization.
- `sample_images/`: Folder with grayscale test images.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 🖼️ Visualization Highlights
We extract and display:
- Input grayscale image
- Intermediate feature maps
- Final colorized output

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **PSNR**: 24.7 dB
- **SSIM**: 0.81

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `Task1.ipynb`
2. Run all cells
3. View visualizations of intermediate stages
