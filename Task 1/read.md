# Task 1 - Visualizing the Colorization Process

## 📌 Objective
This task demonstrates the process of colorizing grayscale images using a CNN-based model. The key focus is to **visualize intermediate stages** of the colorization process to understand how the model progressively adds color.

## 🛠️ Files Included
- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for preprocessing, training, and visualization.
- `sample_images/`: Folder with grayscale test images.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 🖼️ Visualization Highlights
We extract and display:
- Input grayscale image
- Intermediate feature maps
- Final colorized output

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **PSNR**: 24.7 dB
- **SSIM**: 0.81

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `Task1.ipynb`
2. Run all cells
3. View visualizations of intermediate stages
