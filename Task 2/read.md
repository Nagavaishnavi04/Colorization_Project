# Task 2 - Colorization of Historical Photographs

## üéØ Objective
Colorization of historical photographs. Description: Create a model for colorizing historical images, with a focus on faithfully replicating the hues of specific historical periods (for example, World War II and the 1920s). Guidelines: This job needs you to refine your model using a dataset of historical photos. The emphasis should be on historical accuracy in colorization. A GUI is not required, but if one is provided, users should be able to select the historical period before colorization.
