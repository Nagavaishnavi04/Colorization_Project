# Task 3 - Cross-Domain Image Colorization

## 🎯 Objective
Cross-Domain Image Colorization Description: Implement a model for colorizing images in many domains, such as converting black-and-white sketches to completely colorized images or infrared satellite images into visually interpretable color images. Guidelines: The model should be adaptable enough to handle many sorts of input photos while employing appropriate colorization algorithms for each domain. The GUI should allow users to choose the domain of the input image and preview the colorized output.

## 🛠️ Files Included
- `task3_cross_domain_colorization.ipynb`: Notebook with logic to colorize based on selected domain.
- `input_samples/`: Example inputs for each domain.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency list.
